# ATDL3

## Molecular Analysis Scripts

This repository is part of **Assignment 3** of the Advanced Topics in Deep Learning course. It contains Python scripts and a JSON file for analyzing molecular structures, focusing on atom counts, valency, and functional group identification.

### Files

- **atom_counts.py**: Functions to calculate and analyze atom counts in molecular structures.

- **valence.py**: Methods for determining atom valency within molecules, including checks to ensure calculated valency aligns with expected values.

- **compare.py**: Compares molecular properties across different structures, potentially including atom counts, valency, and other characteristics.

- **functional_groups.json**: A JSON file mapping common functional groups to SMILES patterns, enabling quick functional group identification.

For more details and selected molecules with valence errors, visit the [project page](https://github.com/tommycarstensen/atdl3).
